SELECT customerID, FirstName, LastName, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <>'USA'
GROUP BY country

--Show only the customers from Brazil
SELECT customerID, FirstName, LastName, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country ='Brazil'

--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil
SELECT CUST.customerID, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceID, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
WHERE inv.billingcountry ='Brazil'

--Show employees who are Sales Agents
SELECT FirstName, LastName, title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title like '%Agent%'

--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table
SELECT billingcountry as 'Billing Country'
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY billingcountry 

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers
