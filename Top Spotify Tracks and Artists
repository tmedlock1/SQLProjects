--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.  I then turned it into a Table in SQLlite.  Finally, I ran the following SQL queries on the data.


--Create Table from Excel File
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )


--Select All item in table 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata


--What are the Top 10 Songs by Popularity 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10


--What is the average danceability?
SELECT avg(danceability) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata


--Who are the Top 10 Artists based on Popularity?
SELECT distinct artist_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10


--What artist released the longest Song? What was the name of the song?
SELECT distinct artist_name, track_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1

--Determine the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
